##### An open achievement standard for the Playdate console.

1. _Play_ Playdate games!
2. _Earn_ achievements!
3. _View_ them in your Trophy Case!

Playdate Achievements is a community project establishing an open standard for achievements in [Playdate](https://play.date)‚Ñ¢ games. Playdate is fun! Games on Playdate are fun! Achievements in games on Playdate are fun! Having a standard ensures a consistent experience for players, and makes it possible to view achievements earned across games in one place.

## _Everything_ On Display

[Trophy Case](https://gurtt.dev/trophy-case) is a dedicated viewer which displays the achievements you‚Äôve earned across _all_ Playdate games in one place. Trophy Case was designed in parallel with the Playdate Achievements standard, providing first-class support for its features and showcasing any games which choose to integrate with it.

Of course, games may also present their earned achievements themselves. Additionally, the open standard makes it possible for others to create dedicated achievement viewer apps in the future.
